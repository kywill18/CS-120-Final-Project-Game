# CS-120-Final-Project-Game

CS 120 Final Game Pseudo - Code:

A turn based combat game. Based on Street Fighter/Pokemon Battles

Using the TBC file for our TBC project 
(changing a few things)

Class Hero 

Class Enemy 

Class Game 


self.name = name -> “Player” “Enemy”

self.hitPoints = hitPoints -> HP 

self.hitChance = hitChance -> the chance that the attack hits the other character (50/50 just to be fair)

self.maxDamage = maxDamage -> the max amount of damage the character can do to the other

self.armor = armor -> can deflect damage. the points that are deflected don’t subtract from hitPoints


if i have time:
-add a dice component where who ever gets the higher number gets to attack first

-having move characters that do basic idle movements

-maybe a start screen?
