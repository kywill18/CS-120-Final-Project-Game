# CS-120-Final-Project-Game

You player as a character who comes across an enemy and have to fight them. This will play out automatically.

Throughout this project I definitely learned that some of the simple ideas that you might come up can actually be trickier than they look.

I got stuck on taking the text based version of the program and put it in pygame.

I would like to improve the quality of the game and maybe just have more user input.

I mostly stayed with my first idea but I did get rid of a few things to make it less challenging.
